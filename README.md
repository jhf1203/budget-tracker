### Description
      
This is a simple application that allows the user to easily enter debits and credits to an account of their choosing.  

The biggest appeal for this application to the user is the fact that it will still record and save data even when offline.  That way should someone be traveling or otherwise in an area with low or zero signal, they're still able to log and track their financial accounts.

### Usage

#### Demo

#### Instructions

To use this application, simply enter a description for the debit/credit to your account, as well as the amount that the value should be.  As you select to either add funds or subtract funds, you'll see your total balance change at the top of the screen, as well as a visualization of your account history in the form of a line graph.

This application has been specially designed to work even though you may not be online.  Although your information is stored in our database, we have the ability to save each record temporarily should you have no internet, and then post it to our database once you are in an area that has better coverage.
